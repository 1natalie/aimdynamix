# DEI

Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging are fundamental to achieving our mission with the involvement in Healthcare at AIM DYNAMIX. We know that systemic racism, poverty and discrimination negatively impact the overall health and wellness of our communities. It is our responsibility to take action.

By respecting and understanding cultural differences, we enhance our ability to provide culturally sensitive involvement. Increasing cultural competence starts with understanding our own biases and shifting our approach when we interact with others who may be different from ourselves. This reduces the potential for physical, emotional or psychological harm to those who entrust us.

We are accountable to our employees and people who live in the communities we serve—of all races, ethnicities, gender identities, sexualities, abilities and economic means.

To elevate and celebrate our diversity, we apply our creative problem solving skills to all aspects of life at AIM DYNAMIX, from the moment a potential applicant hears our name to the everyday employee experience. We insist on equitable practices not only because it is the right thing to do, but also because it helps us develop the best possible product by enabling each employee to realize their full potential in an environment where they know they belong.

#### What diversity, equity, inclusion & belonging mean to us?

Diversity: Embracing and investing in our differences to create a better us.

Equity: Providing access to opportunities that support our communities' ability to reach its full potential. Creating solutions, informed by an understanding of unique needs that eliminate barriers to success and fill in opportunity gaps.

Inclusion: Cultivating a safe environment where you always bring your whole self, contribute and thrive.

A Responsibility. An opportunity.

Advancing diversity, equity, inclusion & belonging is our responsibility. But it’s also an opportunity. To promote respect and understanding. To eliminate barriers that prevent people from living their fullest lives.
