# Modernizing Care Infastructure

Applying OCR and natural language processing to derive meaning from unstructured data and clinician audio recordings form the basis of modernizing patient records. Super-Intelligence AIM AI, qualified study coordinators and site management associates are key to the successful management of full scale integrations. With this modernization, data science teams can create ML models that improve patient diagnosis, patient treatment plans, and better outcomes.

Tackle the questions and challenges most important to you. Using avant-garde AIM DYNAMIX EMR data serves as a starting point that enables training bespoke AI algorithms.

We develop these algorithms as solutions to some of the major challenges in healthcare, including early detection and diagnosis of disease, identification of biomarkers for disease progression and more.

Before enhanced image processing and ML models, the existing processes to determine tumor size and volume relied on manual measurements by the oncologist, which is error-prone and inconsistent. New systems use ML models that can create volumetric calculations based on ultrasound images and determine cancer growth projections.
